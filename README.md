# marketune_test

**test description**:  
The task consists of the following  
1 - consume an API that returns an array of 3000 documents.  
2- The returned documents represent the users activities on an ads sharing platform.  
3- **The required** is to visualize the data to show a graph that helps the viewer see the relation between points_in (earned points by the user) against the goal_type (represents the activity that the user did).  
4 - **Bonus**: let the viewer filter the data by a specific date using the createdAt field  
5- json object fields that can exist in documents

* points_in
* points_out
* status

1 - clone this repository  
2 - create a branch and let its name be your email address or whatsapp number  
3 - make a pull request with your branch  
4 - if you could deploy your code at any static content free host like 000webhost add the link to your hosted solution in the reamde file in  your branch
